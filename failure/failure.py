class Failure(object):
    """An immutable object that represents failure.

    Failure objects encapsulate exception information so that they can be
    re-used later to re-raise, inspect, examine, log, print, serialize,
    deserialize...

    For those who are curious, here are a few reasons why the original
    exception itself *may* not be reraised and instead a reraised wrapped
    failure exception object will be instead. These explanations are *only*
    applicable when a failure object is serialized and deserialized (when it is
    retained inside the python process that the exception was created in the
    the original exception can be reraised correctly without issue).

    * Traceback objects are not serializable/recreatable, since they contain
      references to stack frames at the location where the exception was
      raised. When a failure object is serialized and sent across a channel
      and recreated it is *not* possible to restore the original traceback and
      originating stack frames.
    * The original exception *type* can not be guaranteed to be found, workers
      can run code that is not accessible/available when the failure is being
      deserialized. Even if it was possible to use pickle safely it would not
      be possible to find the originating exception or associated code in this
      situation.
    * The original exception *type* can not be guaranteed to be constructed in
      a *correct* manner. At the time of failure object creation the exception
      has already been created and the failure object can not assume it has
      knowledge (or the ability) to recreate the original type of the captured
      exception (this is especially hard if the original exception was created
      via a complex process via some custom exception constructor).
    * The original exception *type* can not be guaranteed to be constructed in
      a *safe* manner. Importing *foreign* exception types dynamically can be
      problematic when not done correctly and in a safe manner; since failure
      objects can capture any exception it would be *unsafe* to try to import
      those exception types namespaces and modules on the receiver side
      dynamically (this would create similar issues as the ``pickle`` module in
      python has where foreign modules can be imported, causing those modules
      to have code ran when this happens, and this can cause issues and
      side-effects that the receiver would not have intended to have caused).

    TODO(harlowja): use parts of http://bugs.python.org/issue17911 and the
    backport at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/traceback2/ to (hopefully)
    simplify the methods and contents of this object...
